      <description>How many times do you connect with SSH to your remote server and cat, grep, tail and awk through your logs? It probably works for 3 servers and running a handful services, but if you have more, you should definitely spend some time to centralize your logs.
I personally prefer Graylog2 which can deal very well with different log formats like GELF, Syslog RFC&amp;rsquo;s. Just start some listener with the format and forward them to your Graylog2 instance.</description>
