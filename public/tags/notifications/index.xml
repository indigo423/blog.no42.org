      <description>In some cases it is nice to have notifications from OpenNMS in a separate channel on a smartphone and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for SMS. Here is a tutorial where I use Signal using the signal-cli.
This Howto will describe how to download the latest signal-cli tool, link it to your existing Signal account and how to configure OpenNMS to use it as a notification target. You should have already an OpenNMS Horizon or Meridian running and you need a Signal account with the Signal app installed and configured on your smartphone.</description>
