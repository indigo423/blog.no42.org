      <description>I was listening to an interesting talk from Laura Frank from Codeship. In case you build or maintain a Continuous {Integration, Delivery} environment this definitely worth watching and they describe how they used LXC and now Docker to build their CI/CD infrastructure.
TL;DR Interesting to me, the description in the YAML file reminded me quickly on a course I needed to pass during my study in parallel computing. The exam had one section where you had to describe parallel and sequential processes with some high level constructs.</description>
