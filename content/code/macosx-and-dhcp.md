Iâ€™m using _Mac OS X_ with [iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html), [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and spend 75% of my time in those terminals.
It is totally annoying to me if I connect to a _DHCP_ network and it screws up my hostname.
Especially when I'm used to looking at the prompt which tells me the host I'm connected to.

It is possible to fix your computer name for several things using the `scutil` command which requires administration permissions.
I've found a link to the [Mac OS X Server Worksheet](http://images.apple.com/server/docs/Worksheet_v10.4.pdf) which explains a few things in more detail.
Here is what I did to prevent my computer changing the host name.

User Friendly Name, showed in _Sharing Preference Panel_

```bash
sudo scutil --set ComputerName blinky
```

SSH and Remote login

```bash
sudo scutil --set HostName blinky
```

Name for _Bonjour_, e.g. _Airdrop_

```bash
sudo scutil --set LocalHostName blinky
```

In hope this helps and hope I'll find the page again when I forgot how to do it :)
