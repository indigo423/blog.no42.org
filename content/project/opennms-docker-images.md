The public GitHub repository gives you access to build and run OpenNMS Horizon with Linux Containers using Docker.
With this repository releases of OpenNMS Horizon are triggered to create Docker Container Images and publish them on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/opennms/horizon-core-web/). 

To quick start we provide a [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/opennms-forge/docker-horizon-core-web/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file which downloads the latest stable images.
