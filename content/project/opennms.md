OpenNMS is a free and open source monitoring solution and exists since 2000.
Written in Java and licensed under AGPLv3 it is a tool to monitor service availability and performance from network applications and devices.
As a full time contributor as just one of many, I work mostly on documentation, speak about it on conferences and do workshops with it.
