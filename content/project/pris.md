OpenNMS provides a provisioning system which allows to feed the OpenNMS inventory from external systems.
The Provisioning Integration Server (PRIS) was created as a tool to gain control and flexibility before you start to monitor your devices.
It gives you the ability to write simple adapters to convert any external source in the OpenNMS provisioning model and allows you to run scripts to manipulate your raw inventory data.
