I spent some time with preparing the [OUCE 2015](http://www.opennms.eu/2014/12/ouce-2015-university-of-applied-science-in-fulda/) and we use the free an open source software [frab](http://frab.github.io/frab/) as conference management system.
I do most of my server automation with [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) and my playground is running with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
For this reason I decided to spend some time an built a [Vagrant](https://github.com/frab/vagrant-frab) / [Chef environment](https://github.com/frab/chef-frab) and contributed it back to the frab project.
This guys do a really good job and IMHO it is the best free conference management system you can get.
If you want to play with it feel free and give it a try and contribute.

The last event of the year is the famous [31c3](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Static:Main_Page) in Hamburg.
Itâ€™s always amazing hanging around on this unconference.
We sponsor some bandwidth by mirroring the video streams and we can definitely recognized the beginning of the conference ;)
