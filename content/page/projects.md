* The public GitHub repository gives you access to build and run the AsciiBinder.
The repository is automatically built and published with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/opennms-forge/docker-asciibinder).
Docker images are published on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/opennms/asciibinder/).
* The public GitHub repository gives you access to build and run OpenNMS Horizon with Linux Containers using Docker. With this repository releases of OpenNMS Horizon are triggered to create Docker Container Images and publish them on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/opennms/horizon-core-web/). To quick start we provide a [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/opennms-forge/docker-horizon-core-web/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file which downloads the latest stable images.
* As one of the many contributors, I work with the the OpenNMS project to streamline and optimize documentation for their users. Helping to migrate workflows from wikis to a continuous delivery workflow which is integrated in software development
* OpenNMS is a free and open source monitoring solution and exists since 2000. Written in Java and licensed under AGPLv3 it is a tool to monitor service availability and performance from network applications and devices. As a full time contributor as just one of many, I work mostly on documentation, speak about it on conferences and do workshops with it.
